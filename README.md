# Predictive-analytics-for-patient-readmissions
## Overview
Hospital readmissions are a significant challenge in healthcare, often leading to increased costs and reduced quality of care. Predictive analytics helps healthcare providers identify high-risk patients and take preventive measures to minimize readmission rates.

## Objective: 
Reduce hospital readmissions by predicting high-risk patients within 30 days of discharge.
## Data Sources:
-	Electronic Health Records (EHR).
-	Patient demographics and medical history.
-	Social determinants of health.
-	Discharge summaries.

## Implementation Steps
### 1.	Data Collection
-	Integrate data from hospital systems, including EHRs and patient records.
### 2.	Data Cleaning
-	Handle missing values and outliers.
-	Standardize formats for consistency.
### 3.	Feature Engineering
-	Create relevant features, such as:
  	- Patient age.
    - Comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, hypertension).
    - Previous hospitalizations or emergency visits.
### 4.	Model Development
-	Use machine learning algorithms like Random Forest or XGBoost to build predictive models.
-	Train the model to classify patients as high or low risk for readmission.
### 5.	Deployment
-	Integrate the predictive model into hospital IT systems.
-	Enable real-time flagging of high-risk patients during the discharge process.
### 6.	Monitoring and Maintenance
-	Monitor model performance regularly.
-	Retrain the model with new data to maintain accuracy.
## Tools and Technologies

- Libraries like scikit-learn, pandas for data processing and model development.
#### R: 
- Statistical analysis and visualization.
#### TensorFlow: 
- For building advanced deep learning models if needed.
#### SQL: 
- For querying and managing patient databases.
